<font size="6">About</font>

Question is an Android-based mobile application that serves as a platform for lecture-style polling using the cloud-based system Parse, wherein user accounts and information is stored. It is designed to help professors, an admin, pose a question to a group of students, non-admins, who can answer said question from a list of choices. These answers are stored as responses. The admins and their respective users are part of different groups where there is a collection of questions, both current questions, those can still be answered, and closed questions, those that can only be displayed as responses. Users are either admins or non-admins of individual groups; any user that creates a group is an admin of the group.
